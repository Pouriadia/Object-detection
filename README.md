# Object-detection
This is a matlab application that detects number objects in images and performs calculations on them
We have a database that contains noisy images of blue and red numbers
We assume the blue numbers to be negative and red numbers to be positive
My algorithm will detect these numbers in every picture, and calculate the sum of all the numbers
At last, I will create a new dataset called Reconstructed Images and for every image I use templates to write the sum in green below that image
